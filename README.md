Torch implementation of

(i) Frank-Wolfe algorithm
(ii) Block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm
(iii) Minibatch version of BCFW

In /helpers/helperFn.lua, these are implemented for cifar-10 and mnist:

(i) feature vector computation
(ii) loss function
(iii) max oracle
(iv) primal function, dual function, duality gap
